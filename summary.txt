writeup
1.	The most challenging piece of this assignment is how to make the website look good on both a mobile phone and a desktop computer. To make it look good on a mobile phone, I should modify how the website look based on different screen width. I found it a little challenging to work with HTML and CSS, as there are lot of details to make a personal website look professional and look good. It takes me two afternoons to finish.
2.	Nav-links are set to flexbox, logo is centered, texts like project-texts are changed to single column grid, adjust css based on different maximum width of the screen.
3.	User experience on different devices, prioritization of contents, readability, clean layout, and effective use of space was taken into account
4.	More css animations like change the mouse like, more icons, etc.
5.	About 8 hours
