            <h2 class="project-title">Project1: Distributed Key-Value storage system</h2>
            <ul class="project1-description">
                <li>Engineered a distributed Key-Value storage system with high availability and strong consistency, utilizing the Raft 
                    consensus algorithm for operations including leader election and log replication.
                </li>
                <li>Implemented a Multi-Raft architecture in Java to shared data effectively, enabling migration across multiple Raft Groups
                    to achieve optimal load distribution and resilience.
                </li>
                <li>Designed a Key-Value storage interface that ensures linearizable read and write operations, achieving stringent consistency 
                    levels required for critical applications.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Incorporated asynchronous Apply to increase the throughput and scalability, utilized ReadIndex and FollowerRead to reduce the latency
                    of read operations by 42%, and implemented Prevote strategies to eliminate unnecessary elections to improve the system stability.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Employed MVCC for robust multi-version concurrency control and built on the Percolator model, a distributed database based on BigTable, 
                    to support efficient distributed transactions.
                </li>

            <h2 class="project-title">Project2: High-Performance Distributed Message Queue System</h2>
            <ul class="project2-description">
                <li>Developed a high-performance message queue system in Java with Spring, enabling robust message storage, publish/subscribe patterns, 
                    ordered message delivery, and message persistence with acknowledgments.
                </li>
                <li>Engineered an efficient message storage mechanism comprising advanced data structures and persistent storage solutions, ensuring 
                    reliable message transfer between producers and consumers.
                </li>
                <li>Established guarantees for message order consistency by integrating partitioning techniques and distributed sorting algorithms, 
                    ensuring messages are processed in the correct sequence by consumers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Implemented traffic control protocols to dynamically regulate the message throughput from producers, preventing system overload and 
                    maintaining high availability.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stress tested the system and achieved 5 seconds for the 95% of response times.

            <ul class="project3-description">
                <li>Built a full-stack web application for sharing discount information using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and React.
                </li>
                <li>Created reusable React components for a consistent user interface, and developed dynamic frontend features including an emoji
                    feedback system that boosted user engagement by 35%.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Integrated the open-source Supabase database through RESTful APIs for online database management, enabling efficient categorization and 
                    retrieval of user-posted discount information.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Implemented authentication with Passport.js to realize user authentication and authorization, improving system security.
